//! Witness fault tolerance.
//!
//! KERI events name a set of witnesses and a threshold — the reference's `toad` — of how many must
//! receipt an event for it to count as witnessed. [`ample`] computes the default threshold for a
//! witness set, the smallest count that still tolerates the expected number of faulty witnesses.
//!
//! This module ports `ample` from `src/keri/core/eventing.ts`. All arithmetic is exact integer
//! arithmetic: `AGENTS.md` §2.4 forbids floating point for protocol thresholds, and the reference's
//! `Math.ceil`/`Math.floor` results are reproduced with checked integer division.

/// Which majority a witness threshold has to clear.

/// disagree — the smallest is six, where a weak threshold is 4 and a strong one 5.
